install python first.
then open vs code
in vs code terminal write: 
Check python: python --version
virtual environment creation: python -m venv ven
Then activate virtual environment: venv\Scripts\activate
if get error during it activation open windows PowerShell as admin then
write: Get-ExecutionPolicy
the output will be: Restricted
then write: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

after that  in vs code terminal write: venv\Scripts\activate


Step 1: See what’s overriding

Run this in PowerShell (anywhere):

Get-ExecutionPolicy -List


You’ll see something like:

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
UserPolicy          Undefined
Process             Bypass
CurrentUser         RemoteSigned
LocalMachine        AllSigned


👉 The one at the top with a defined value (MachinePolicy or UserPolicy) is overriding everything else.

🧩 Step 2: If MachinePolicy or UserPolicy shows something like “AllSigned” or “Restricted”

That means a Group Policy is controlling it.
If you’re on a work or school PC, this is often set by your IT admin — you’ll need admin rights to change it.

If this is your own PC, we can fix it manually via the local policy editor 👇

🧰 Step 3: Change execution policy via Local Group Policy Editor

Press Win + R

Type:

gpedit.msc


and press Enter (opens Local Group Policy Editor)

Navigate to:

Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows PowerShell


On the right, double-click:
“Turn on Script Execution”

Set it to:

✅ Enabled

Then select Allow local scripts and remote signed scripts

Click Apply → OK

⚙️ Step 4: Close and reopen VS Code

Then run in your VS Code terminal:

venv\Scripts\activate


You should now see:

(venv) PS J:\face-recognition-attendance>


🎉 Your virtual environment should finally activate!
